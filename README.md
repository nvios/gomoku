# Gomoku (with AI!) written with HTML5 technology

The game supports both mobile and desktop (heck, it can even be an iOS webapp).

I use JQuery Mobile for the interface.

The AI is based on the nega-scout framework, with same caching using JavaScript Object
as a hash table. It runs parallel to the page using the HTML5 Web Worker.
